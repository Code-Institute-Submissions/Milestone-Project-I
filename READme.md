Website : https://amantamu.github.io/Milestone-Project-I/
Github : https://github.com/amantamu/Milestone-Project-I

This is essentially reflects what it will be after I finish my Full Stack Web Development course. The project is simple and easy to read. 

### UX
The project is portfolio website which aim is to have simple layout and easy to navigate. Easy to read whole website with a look.
* As to make simple and easy to read, I put text with icon.
* To find which page you are in, I have to put outline in the navigation bar.

You can find wireframes of the website in above assest folder.

### Features
* I put hover effect on the nav bar where the bordor and color changes.
* The footer icon color changes
* Nav bar is fixed to left always.

I wanted to have nav bar left at desktop view and bottom in mobile view. I also wanted to have welcome page or a pop up page, when you visit website there is a greeting to user. 

### Technologies Used
* HTML : It is used for a structure of web page.
* CSS : It is used for a decoration of web page.
* Bootstrap : It is used for responsive layout of web page.


### Testing
The testing part is simple. Try clicking/hover on nav bar icons and footer. Download icon takes you to the new tab and opens a cv document. You can see if the website is responsive or not. Try changing screen view size from desktop to mobile view.
* Go to contact page and try summiting with empthy inputs. 
* Try to summit with invalid inputs.
* Now try to summit with valid inputs.

### Deployment
I used Vistual Studio Code (VS Code). I used it beacause it easier and faster to run and there are extension that helps you with the code. Using git was easy in VS code and it shows you how many commits you have not done. I did not like the cloud base platform, it takes few minute to open up. I used git to save and control and github to deploy my live web page. 

* If you want to run it locally then download or copied above files. Mkae sure you save it in new folder where there is no similar name files, like index.html or style.css. I recommend to use vs code.
