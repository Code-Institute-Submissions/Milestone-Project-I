Project Name: Portfolia after I graduate

Website link: 

This is my portfolia website of my skills and ability after I complete the course. This is just kind of sample portfolio. The concept of the website is that I will be efficient in all front end and back end. I will be good enough to be able to use all these skills and abilities to make a good website. And I have the problem solving skill and always curious to learn new things.



UX

My design was to have side navigation bar. And it should look like mobile application with icon and small titles.

Features


Contact form:
Go to the "Contact" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

Here, you can see I am will to work with somebody if he/she is interested. 




Deployment

I did all my code in visual studio code. I didn't know how to push my project from vsc into the github. And some reason I forgot word 'help' ,so yeah!!. After I completed the project in visual studio code, I move to gitpod and push my project in github. You can find all the file and code in assets file.
