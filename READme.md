### Milestone Project 1 (Portfolio)

Website : https://amantamu.github.io/Milestone-Project-I/
Github : https://github.com/amantamu/Milestone-Project-I

This is essentially reflects what it will be after I finish my Full Stack Web Development course. The project is simple and easy to read. 

### User Story
My main part of the project was to be simple and readable and responsive. Especially for mobile devices, so I went for like mobile devices layout. After my research, I got to know that most mobile devices had icons and navigation bar. I have use icons and navigation bar. I have used icons for title/heading, section, sub-section and footer. My main mobile devices like layout to me was navigation bar. Most mobile devices layout have navbar or menubar somewhere at the screen. And it is fixed in same place. When you change screen size(mobile size), you can always see nagivation/menu bar at the left side of the screen. You can try changing screen size and see how it goes. Hope you like it!!!

### UX
The project is portfolio website which aim is to have simple layout and easy to navigate. Easy to read whole website with a look.
* As to make simple and easy to read, I put text with icon.
* To find which page you are in, I have put bordor in "active" page in the navigation bar.

You can find wireframes of the website in above assests folder.

### Features
* I put hover effect on the nav bar where the bordor and color changes.
* The footer icon color changes.
* Nav bar is fixed to left always.
* The submit button changes, it's color and shape when hover to it.

I wanted to have nav bar left at desktop view and bottom in mobile view. I also wanted to have greeting/welcome page or a pop up page, when you visit the website. 

### Technologies Used
* HTML : It is used for a structure of web page.
* CSS : It is used for a decoration of web page.
* Bootstrap : It is used for responsive layout of web page.


### Testing
The testing part is simple. Try clicking/hover on nav bar icons and footer changes color and shape. Download icon takes you to the new tab and opens a CV document. You can see if the website is responsive or not. Try changing screen view size from desktop to mobile view.
* Go to contact page and try submiting with empthy inputs. 
* Try to submit with invalid inputs.
* Now try to submit with valid inputs.

### Deployment
I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code). I used it beacause it easier and faster to run and there are extension that helps you with the code. Using git was easy in VS code and it shows you how many commits you have not done. I did not like the cloud base platform, it takes few minute to open up. After a while you have to restart/refresh the page in cloud based platform. I used git to save and control and github to deploy my live web page. 

* If you want to run it locally then download or copied above files. Make sure you save it in new folder where there is no similar name files, like index.html or style.css. I recommend to use vs code.
